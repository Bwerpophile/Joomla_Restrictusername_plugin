# Joomla_Restrictusername_plugin
A simple plugin made with Chat GPT to check if a username respect certains conditions before being register. 

Just upload the zip in your joomla extension manager and activate the plugin in your plugin configuration. 

You should now receive an error in the administration side if the username :
- is capitalize
- has any special caractere apart from : '@' , '-' or '_'


Feel free to use it and change the Regex if needed.
